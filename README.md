### üîç Script Runner - Automated Quality Checks

The Script Runner is a powerful feature that ensures your code meets production standards by running automated checks and fixing issues automatically.

#### Overview

The Script Checks section appears directly above the message input area, providing instant access to quality validation tools. All scripts are visible and can be enabled/disabled with checkboxes.

#### Built-in Scripts

1. **Production Readiness Check** üè≠
   - Scans for TODOs, FIXMEs, placeholders, and incomplete implementations
   - Ensures no debug code or temporary solutions remain
   - Validates error handling and edge cases

2. **Build Check** üî®
   - Automatically detects your project's build system (npm, go, cargo, dotnet, etc.)
   - Runs the appropriate build command
   - Ensures code compiles without errors

3. **Test Check** ‚úÖ
   - Detects and runs your test suite
   - Supports multiple test frameworks across languages
   - Ensures all tests pass before proceeding

4. **Format Check** üíÖ
   - Validates code formatting standards
   - Detects formatters (prettier, gofmt, rustfmt, etc.)
   - Ensures consistent code style

5. **GitHub Actions Check** üöÄ
   - Validates workflow YAML syntax
   - Checks for deprecated actions
   - Ensures CI/CD pipelines are correctly configured

#### Using Script Runner

1. **Enable/Disable Scripts**
   - Click checkboxes to select which scripts to run
   - Scripts only run when enabled
   - Your selection is saved automatically

2. **Reorder Scripts** 
   - Drag scripts using the handle icon (‚ò∞)
   - Numbers (1, 2, 3...) show execution order
   - Order affects fix priority - earlier scripts are fixed first

3. **Run Individual Scripts** ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
   - Each script has its own run button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) on the right
   - Click to run just that specific script
   - Useful for debugging or checking specific aspects
   - Results shown via VS Code notifications

4. **Run All - "Run Checks"** üîç
   - Executes all enabled scripts once
   - Shows results with ‚úÖ pass or ‚ùå fail status
   - Displays specific errors found
   - No automatic fixing - just validation

5. **Fix Loop - "Run Loop"** üîÑ
   - Runs all enabled scripts
   - If any fail, asks Claude to fix the issues
   - Re-runs scripts after fixes
   - Continues until all pass or max iterations reached
   - Set max iterations (1-20, default: 5)

6. **Custom Scripts** üìù
   - Add your own validation scripts to `.autoclaude/scripts/`
   - Scripts automatically appear in the UI
   - Must output JSON format:
   ```json
   {
     "passed": true/false,
     "errors": ["error1", "error2"],
     "warnings": ["warning1"] // optional
   }
   ```
   - Support any language (bash, python, node, etc.)
   - Examples provided in `.autoclaude/scripts/examples/`

#### Script Configuration

Scripts are configured in `.autoclaude/config.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "production-check": {
      "enabled": true,
      "order": 1
    },
    "build": {
      "enabled": true,
      "order": 2
    }
  },
  "maxIterations": 5
}
```

  "autoclaude.parallelAgents.staggerDelay": 10,
  "autoclaude.parallelAgents.contextThreshold": 20,
  "autoclaude.parallelAgents.autoRestart": true,
  "autoclaude.parallelAgents.coordinationEnabled": false
}
```

### üîÑ Loop Features - Intelligent Task Refinement

AutoClaude provides two powerful loop features that ensure your tasks are completed to perfection.

#### 1. Script Fix Loop (Global)

The **"Run Loop"** button runs all enabled scripts repeatedly until they pass:

**How it works:**
1. Runs all enabled script checks
2. If any fail, sends errors to Claude with fix request
3. Claude implements fixes based on error messages
4. Scripts run again to verify fixes
5. Continues until all pass or max iterations reached

**Best for:**
- Preparing code for production deployment
- Ensuring all quality standards are met
- Automated code cleanup and refactoring
- Pre-commit quality assurance

**Example workflow:**
```
1. Enable: Production Check, Build, Test, Format
2. Click "Run Loop" with max iterations = 5
3. Claude fixes TODOs ‚Üí Build errors ‚Üí Test failures ‚Üí Formatting
4. All scripts pass ‚Üí Code is production-ready!
```

#### 2. Message Loop (Individual Tasks)

The **üîÑ button** on each message runs that specific task in a quality loop. **Note: Hover over a pending message to see the action buttons including the loop button (üîÑ).**

**How it works:**
1. Processes the individual message/task
2. Runs enabled script checks on the changes
3. If checks fail, asks Claude to fix while maintaining task completion
4. Re-runs scripts after fixes
5. Ensures task is both complete AND high quality

**Best for:**
- Complex features that need refinement
- Tasks requiring multiple iterations
- Ensuring individual changes meet standards
- Focused quality improvement

**Example workflow:**
```
Message: "Add user authentication with JWT"
1. Click üîÑ on the message
2. Claude implements authentication
3. Scripts find: missing error handling, no tests
4. Claude adds error handling and tests
5. All checks pass ‚Üí Feature is complete and production-ready!
```

#### Loop Configuration

Control loop behavior with these settings:

- **Max Iterations**: 1-20 (default: 5)
  - Lower for quick fixes
  - Higher for complex refactoring
  
- **Script Selection**: Enable only relevant scripts
  - Faster loops with fewer scripts
  - More thorough with all scripts

- **Smart Ordering**: Drag scripts to prioritize
  - Put critical checks first
  - Format checks last

#### Pro Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with 1-2 scripts, add more as needed
2. **Watch Progress**: Each iteration shows what was fixed
3. **Trust the Process**: Let Claude handle the fixes
4. **Custom Standards**: Add your own scripts for team standards
5. **Combine Features**: Queue messages + loops = fully automated development

## üìö Wiki & Documentation

### Core Concepts

**Queue Processing**: AutoClaude maintains a persistent queue of messages that can be processed automatically. Each message represents a task or instruction for Claude Code.

**Auto-Resume**: When Claude Code hits usage limits, AutoClaude automatically detects this and schedules the queue to resume when limits reset.

**Workspace Integration**: Each VS Code workspace maintains its own queue and history, allowing you to manage multiple projects independently.

**Dependency Management**: AutoClaude automatically checks for and validates all required dependencies (Claude Code, Python) before starting.

### Advanced Features

**Batch Operations**: Process multiple related tasks in sequence with consistent context and state management.

**Queue Management**: Full CRUD operations on queue items - add, edit, remove, duplicate, and reorder messages as needed.

**History Tracking**: Complete history of all processing runs with filtering and search capabilities.

**Cross-Platform**: Native support for Windows, macOS, and Linux with platform-specific optimizations.
